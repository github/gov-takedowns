Finally Spain shares an entry in https://github.com/github/gov-takedowns with China and Russia. The Spanish government is involved in a witch hunting that attempts to prosecute any person or group of persons that want to peacefully protest against the status quo. In order to give some foundation to what I'm saying, let me enumerate some sources that show some hints that something wrong is happening in Spain about freedom of speech and public assembly.

1. [Brussels backs exiled rapper's arguments against extradition](https://www.catalannews.com/politics/item/brussels-backs-exiled-rapper-s-arguments-against-extradition): the rap singer Valtonyc is currently exiled in Belgium to avoid jail in Spain for the lyrics of some of his songs. The Belgian justice already rejected the extradition request.

2. [UN rights experts criticise Spanish efforts to block Catalan vote](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/28/un-rights-experts-criticise-spanish-efforts-to-block-catalan-vote): UN human rights experts have weighed in on the escalating row over Catalonia’s independence referendum, warning the Spanish authorities that their “worrying” efforts to halt Sunday’s poll appear to violate fundamental rights and risk stifling debate “at a critical moment for Spain’s democracy”.

3. [Spain: Excessive use of force by National Police and Civil Guard in Catalonia](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/10/spain-excessive-use-of-force-by-national-police-and-civil-guard-in-catalonia/): the same police that wrote Github for the takedown was accused by Amnisty International for excessive use of force.

4. [SPAIN: Authorities must de-escalate tensions and guarantee the right to public assembly](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2019/10/spain-authorities-must-deescalate-tensions-and-guarantee-the-right-to-public-assembly/): here, Amnisty International is warning Spain about guaranteeing the right to public assembly.

5. [European Comission warns Spain about prosecuting Tsunami Democratic](https://diario16.com/la-comision-europea-da-un-toque-de-atencion-a-espana-por-la-persecucion-de-tsunami-democratic/): the comission recently warned Spain to preserve speech expression after shutting down Tsunami Democratic's movement websites. 


Spain is a democracy, but it still preserves some behaviors more typical from the fascist regime that preceded. Spain is currently accusing of terrorism a movement that emphasizes its peaceful nature. Nobody died, no bomb was put, no gun was shot by any protester in Catalonia. Tsunami Democratic is just a platform for coordinating protests of people whose reasons are legit and always in a peaceful manner. Spain is using some incidents done by a minority (the worst action was just burning trash containers) for accusing the entire movement of terrorism.
