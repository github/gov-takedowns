Hi there! We're thrilled that you're interested in our Government Takedowns repo. As our [README](README.md) explains, 
>the purpose of this repository is to publicly post notices that result in GitHub blocking content that a government notifies us is illegal. GitHub created this repository for transparency with our community when we block content in response to a complete government takedown notice. We publicly post those notices, unchanged (other than redactions of personal information), because we are concerned about Internet censorship, and believe that transparency on a specific and ongoing level is essential to good governance. 
>
>Discussion in this repo should relate to this purpose. 
>
>We do not accept Pull Requests in this repository because the notices we post are verbatim from the notifying government.
